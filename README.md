# HepatitisC-diagnosis (CSPE21 Project)
The project involves analysis of the Hepatitis C dataset. 
The data set contains laboratory values of blood donors and Hepatitis C patients and demographic values like age. The data was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HCV+data

The target attribute for classification is Category (5): blood donors, suspect Blood Donor, Hepatitis C, Fibrosis, Cirrhosis.

This project involves implementation of various models with different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors in Python. This project diagnosis the hepatitis C disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features a a variety of parameters, and the target variable is a multiclass variable with 5 different classes.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

  1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
  2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
  3. Support Vector Machine (Scikit-learn)
  4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
  5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
  6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
  7. Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)

Accuracy achieved: 99% (Random Forest)
